## habits, self-realisation and mindset-shift

It has been exactly 3 months since I last worked on my research project. I haven't done anything tangential till now.
I do have a plan on the same, on how to go about it. A lot has happened in the last 3 months, especially in the last month alone, which I'll be addressing. 

I have the habit of procrastinating/postponing things just because I can focus other things at hand. For e.g., researching and publishing a literature review paper (not an example, precisely this).
I want to break out of the procrastinating cycle of mine, and therefore this effort and rambling about the same. 

The things that have happened in the last month has been tangential in my life though. Funny how one single realisation can make an entire routine/perspective shift.
I experiened just that, my thought-process, sub-conscious and everything in my body is filled with one single goal right now. Just like Swami's Vivekananda's quote:
"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, and every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced."
Hopefully, I make it. We make it. 

Professional tangetial changes: me working with gen-ai and it's been really insightful.
Before working on llms and gen-ai, I had a very different perspective about the same. Trust me when I say this, it's all deeper than just "prompting".
I got black-holed into this world of endless fine-tuning, optimising and formatting. It's been approx 20 days and it's awesome!
I've come a long way with respect to my understanding of llms and gen-ai. I still have a long way to go. I'm thrilled.
This new job is a level up towards my future goal. Since that idea took over me, I've not been able to feel leisure without feeling guilty.
I'm consumed by it. I need a way out and that is only levelling up. 

I need to make my life interesting to escape this monotony. It's up to me. Life is all about finding the balance between the leisure and the guilt that comes along with it. 
This realisation has been impactful in ways I never thought of. 

In the end, hopium (hope as opium/drug) all the way, get really high with it, believe, one day before we can realise, we'd have achieved our goal. 
(Caution: make sure the hopium levels are realistic. :P)
