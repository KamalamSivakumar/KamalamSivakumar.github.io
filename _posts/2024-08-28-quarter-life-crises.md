## quarter-life, to-do list and transitions

I should have added "crises" to my title.  
We all have our own quarter-life crises, and I'm certainly seeing it play out with myself and my peers.   
It's like that Instagram quote: "In your 20s, one friend is married, one has a baby, one is engaged, one is traveling the world, one is living with their parents, one is still dating, and one is single and figuring it out. We’re all on different paths, but we’re all doing just fine."  
We really are fine. We're slowly becoming our parents, but in a good way. We’re adults now—taking care of ourselves, finding joy in longer conversations with our parents, checking in on friends without needing hours to catch up, and doing things just for those small wins.  
We’re figuring it out.

Speaking of being adults—let's talk about that ever-present to-do list. I used to be the kind of person who wrote everything down with pen and paper every single day. My thozhan always did things digitally, and he introduced me to an app called Habitica, which gamifies habit-building, and honestly, it’s really cool. I used to say to him, "Nan always paper and pen dan paa." because I enjoyed the satisfaction of crossing off tasks with a pen rather than clicking a checkbox. But as life got busier, I couldn’t keep up with writing everything down. Initially, I resisted but using the app made more sense than writing it all with a pen. I started using and loving it.  

This experience has made me realize that the changes we face might be like this—something we resist at first, but end up embracing when we can rationalize it. Growing into change is a huge part of being an adult, and when we manage that, it’s one less quarter-life crisis to worry about before it turns into a midlife one.  

Maybe it's because of COVID, but until about five months ago, I never really felt my age. I still felt like I was twenty-two, even when I was twenty-four. But now, something's shifted—a lot has changed within me, and I can feel it. I’m about to turn twenty-five, and for the first time, I actually feel my age.

Here’s to the second half of my quarter-life crises—taking it one day at a time.
