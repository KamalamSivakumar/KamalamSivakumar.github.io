## preference, context and trade-offs

It's both curious and a bit sad that I only think of writing a blog at exact monthly intervals.
This time, at least, I've managed to shorten the interval to 1 month instead of 3. 
Moving on from the obvious, this blog is about how preferences and context matter in this world of ai|business|texts|everything.  
Fair warning: I will be using copious amounts of the word "ai".

Personally, I'm building my portfolio and I need to showcase projects with ai/ml and so I take up use cases that are mostly nichey, but also do-able. 
The following opinion is based on my perception of how context should be viewed.

Context, a highly subjective yet crucial factor, dynamically shapes the method of doing things in the world. In the "context" of ai, context matters even more.
Why we need to do what we need to do is the crux here. Recently I've been seeing ai-refrigerators, ai-ac, ai-tv, ai-anything, while 99% of them are marketing 
gimmicks, they do make "ai" the buzzword and in turn making the innovations|research prevalent. I don't mean to pull down other interesting cs areas here.  
Having established my base opinion, we don't have to always incorporate ai. Doesn't make sense to incorporate an extensive context vector-store and search model for the use-case where a keyword search is going to be efficient.
We don't have to do things or implement strenuous tasks just because we need to look or sound cool. And we need not refrain from incorporating ai as well, everything is good when we base it on a trade-off. 

Speaking of trade-offs, preference comes into the play. Again a highly subjective word, you get the "context" :P.  
The methodology in question would shape up when we have both our preference and context sorted out. That is the hard part in my opinion. Often, like our life instances, when context aligns our preference may not and the vice-versa, at the end it's always about trade-offs.  
Find the spot that balances both the context and preference i.e., make informed decisions. Develop a methodology. Implement. Complete. 

Up until now, I know my blog posts are more about tech+life and not just tech|life. If this is an issue, please reach out and I'll work on it.  
Thanks for reading.
