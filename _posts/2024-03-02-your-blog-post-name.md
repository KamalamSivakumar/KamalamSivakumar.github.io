## people around, people within

Like my amma says, "You'll meet people of various degrees(or personalities)", I feel we all have multiple variations of ourselves, that would be dependent on who we are around. Some people show their best selves if they are around someone, some behave harshly, and the vice-versa is possible too. I feel that we emulate the behaviours of people we dearly love, either emulate or do the exact opposite, nonetheless base it upon them. I have an understanding of myself in this aspect. As I navigate through all of this with others, I find it difficult to gauge a person's base personality (not the variations), even when I've known them for a long time. Why should I gauge? To understand where they keep me, is it a two-way street with them, and to understand where I should keep them. 

Handling a misunderstanding is one of the places where a person's base character can be judged. One side chooses to ignore the problem or ignore the other person, sticking only to their version and not being ready to hear, and the other makes an effort to clarify the same, there's nothing in between. (provided the misunderstanding is reasonable and not delusional, please take it with a grain of salt)

All this said a single trait plays a huge part. Ego. The extent to which one is willing to go to either discount the entirety or take it up. My best friend rightly said, that there's a very thin line between ego and self-esteem. One must be nurtured and the other pruned. Sometimes, people can be self-absorbed, unaware that true fulfillment comes from understanding and cherishing our loved ones, rather than being consumed by petty chaos and drama. 

Life is very unpredictable to not hold onto people, even if it means to lose our pride/ego.

Recently I witnessed a close relative's unexpected passing, he peacefully passed away in his sleep. Heart-wrenching, it was very sudden. The house after a death, is a vortex of emotions and talk, some heartfelt, some gossip. When we observe keenly from afar, the jarring silence, the silent cries, emotions being talked, and kids playing, it feels like a solace of being present and mourning the blessed soul. It made me question a lot of things and humans present there, honestly. Some questions were of course meta, but some paradoxical. We often get caught on our chance to win at life or hop on to the rat race, but we rarely think about why we do what we do or what we want to do, or why we are the way we are, as an individual and as a collective conscious.

I call this question (i know a big one, bear with me) paradoxical because it seems meta at first, but when pondered upon, I seemed to brush it off by stating "That's how it is, and I am born into this reality" without an explanation, accepting my place. At the same time, I'm curious to know if there is any such thing as fate and fate being inter-twined, am I making a difference in people's lives? what happens if I obliviate? Okay, that turned dark all of a sudden. Sorry! :P Everything at some point in pondering is paradoxical and pointless. Maybe life's all about making choices that won't make us regret, and those choices may one day answer all my questions about why I live the way I live, and why it is the way it is. 

In the end, from a Tamil song,

"பிறப்பை தேர்ந்தெடுக்கும்
இறப்பை தேர்ந்தெடுக்கும்
உரிமை உன்னிடத்தில் இல்லை இல்லை

எண்ணிப் பார்க்கும் வேளையிலே
உன் வாழ்க்கை மட்டும் உந்தன் கையில்
உண்டு அதை வென்று எடு"

(rough translation: we don't get to choose our birth or death; make good choices to make the most of "life" in between).
This song reflects the essence of thoughtful decision-making. Beautiful song.

Do listen to it! [![Kikku Yerudhey]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KKeI6P_7Ho)

Happy choice-making!
