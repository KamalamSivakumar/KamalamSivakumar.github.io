## reinforcement learning - multi-arm-bandits and batched bandit problem - part 4

Why find a lower bound?  
--the minimum number of samples needed to achieve a specific accuracy level  
--understanding the limitations and complexities  
--guiding algorithm design  

Derived based on the lower-bound for pure exploration problems [Pure Exploration with Multiple Correct Answers](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2019/file/60cb558c40e4f18479664069d9642d5a-Paper.pdf)
