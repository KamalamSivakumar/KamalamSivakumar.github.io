## ðŸ“š the clifton chronicles, jeffrey archer
Based on my thozhan's recommendation, I started reading The Clifton Chronicles by Jeffrey Archer.
Such a good series and Iâ€™m on book 5 out of 8, and Iâ€™m so hooked.
The story itself is pretty straightforward, but the way it captures how people think, how they act, and how some are so different from othersâ€”itâ€™s really nice to read about, like watching a warm hearty series.
Plus, seeing how the right connections can completely change someoneâ€™s life and experiences is amazing, and honestly, so relevant!

The story centers around Harry Clifton's life and family, and as Iâ€™m reading the 5th book (which covers his 40s), Iâ€™ve noticed a pattern in the characters and their behavior at different stages.
Thereâ€™s always that one person who acts purely on emotions, completely irrationally (like Hugo Barrington, Major Alex Fisher, Lady Virginia Fenwick, and Don Pedro Martinez).
Then, thereâ€™s always someone who acts rationally and is genuinely trying to help uplift others (Old Jack, Sir Walter Barrington, Mr. Holcombe, Emmaâ€™s Aunt and cousin, Sir Hardcastle).
And of course, thereâ€™s that one person who, in the name of being selfless, ends up doing something downright stupid (Harry in the first book, Sebastian Clifton, Jessica Clifton).
But even with these different character types, everything somehow falls into place. Itâ€™s like the "stupidly selfless" person always crosses paths with the one trying to uplift others, and together they end up dealing with the chaos caused by the irrational ones. It's all just because they happen to be in situations that affect them, and it works out in its own way.

Take Major Alex Fisher, for exampleâ€”his whole grudge against Harry and Giles was just because they were better than him in his eyes, and that he wanted to feel better than them always. He built up that resentment all on his own.
It really shows how comparison steals your happiness. Because of that, he could never be normal around them and kept trying to bring them down. Even when he had the chance to let it go, he just held on tighter to his bitterness.
His arc really drives home the point that intent and being open to change when you are presented with an opportunity are so important, and reading about that character made me want to get into the book and just jolt him to his senses.

What I love most about reading this series is the second groupâ€”the rational, helpful characters. I always brace myself for something really dramatic and disastrous to happen, but instead, something super ordinary and normal takes place only because of how they reacted to the adversity, and honestly, thatâ€™s life.
Itâ€™s such a real reflection of how things work out.

Also! Jeffrey Archer beautifully writes about the characters' love life, how love unfolds in its own space, time, and pace. It's so heartwarming! and feels seamless and genuineâ€”like a low-maintenance, totally heartwarming transition.
Even though I havenâ€™t had as dramatic experiences, reading about them makes me feel kushi about my own love and love life.

I can't wait to finish the 5th book.
Will write a separate blog post about the characters and instances that resonated so much with me.
