## stunning views, ups-downs and feeling habbada

I recently went on a hiking trip to Netravati Peak in Karnataka. It all began with a random phone call: "There's a slot open, want to join?"  
I said yes. The group had 13 people, only 2 of whom were mutual friends, with everyone else somehow connected to them. And honestly, it turned out to be one of the most humbling trips I've ever had—in the best way possible. 

The elevation was 1520m, and the hike itself was 6 km from the base. To even reach the base, we had to walk an extra 3 km after enduring the most insanely tough off-road ride in a kutty-aanai (mini-truck) that was barely manageable. All in all, I ended up walking close to 18 km!  

The hike involved crossing two small streams and climbing three incredibly grueling peaks to finally reach the top. Each of these peaks had steep 80-degree slopes, and after each one, there was a brief flat incline of about 100 meters to catch your breath.  
While tackling the second brutal peak, I glanced up, searching for the final one, and honestly, I almost thought I'd fall behind.

But when I finally reached the summit, it was a huge "habbada" moment. Relief hit me, but then came my next worry—how on earth was I going to descend this 80-degree slope of slippery mud?  
Both the climb and descent were made possible thanks to the help and encouragement of my friends, especially two of them. I owe them a big thank you.

During that last ascent, it hit me how much life is like this hike. We go through some of the most painful, exhausting phases, getting either numb to it or finding a way to deal with it, only for the next phase to roll in.  
But it’s the friends and people around us who give meaning to this whole up-and-down ride, and helping each other out is the only way to keep moving forward and upward.

Throughout my hike, I did a lot of introspection, especially around the idea of low-maintenance friendships and the beauty of small talk. It felt so good connecting with new people, and honestly, small talk is just the best—it’s refreshing when it’s done right.  
If you're someone who values low-maintenance relationships, then small talk becomes the heart of the bond you’re building. 

I loved every bit of the hike. The small moments of connection between random strangers, the hearty exchanges, the good vibes, everything about this trip made me feel wholesome.
