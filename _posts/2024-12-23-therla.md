## backend, consistency and reasons

It's been two months since I last wrote—kinda sad when I think about it.  
A lot has happened in that time. See, that's what we call a reason. But since this is the season for resolutions and goals, mine is simple—just show up starting today, for whatever I think must be done and not procrastinated for realllyyyyy long.

I used to find words like "API" intimidating. That felt like backend engineer jargon—flask, fastapi, django...all the cool things. I knew how to code, but writing APIs? I didn’t think I could.
Cut to a few months later, and I'm writing APIs, and actually getting the hang of it.
Turns out, all I had to do was show up every day to the office. Eventually, it clicked. I made plenty of mistakes along the way, but that’s how we learn, right?

Starting is the hardest part. That's what I’m thinking about every time the cloud of procrastination shows up.  

It’s never too late to begin.

The above two sayings um eh reasons dan, but required ones, aasai irundha porum, arambikalam, arambikanum avlodan goal.
