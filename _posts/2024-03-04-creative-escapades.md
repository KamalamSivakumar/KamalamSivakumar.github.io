## acquaintances, favours and gender
This is applicable irrespective of gender, but me being a female, my post is centred around my experiences.

Premalu. A lovely and humourous movie about navigating through love and relationships. Eventhough I enjoyed the movie, I questioned one thing, every lead guy had a distorted view of love.
The hero, falls in love with any girl who seems to be cheery around him. When the hero confesses to the heroine about his love, he says "you enjoy taking care of me right, that's love right",
to which the heroine says "that's just how I am". Eventually she realises and confesses her love too, but the point I'm trying to make is, 
not everybody may have the same intentions you think that they might have towards you. This was rightly pointed about by my Thozhan. This is what this blog is about.

It's always easy for me to speak or make acquaintances with new people irrespective of gender. 
In school, I was the cheeriest, and liveliest girl/tomboy there could be. In college not as much, but still I used to talk to everybody I was comfortable with. 
I met a girl yesterday, who is 90% similar to how I am, so much so our families are similar too. 
Again, My dearest thozhan pointed that out to me and said that, we were able to talk freely or in an outgoing manner because we never filtered things when we talked to our parents/friends earlier in childhood, 
and thus we go on about yapping anything under the sun to anyone (again we feel comfortable, add this grain of salt wherever applicable).

But this trait of ours, bites us at our bum sometimes, especially when we try to be ourselves with some men/boys (boys is the right word). 
They think we are so easy to talk to and think that we're interested in them, their behaviour would make any girl uncomfortable. The catch is, that they may be our colleague, 
boss or project mate or anybody for that matter, and we'd require their help or their support. I faced such an issue 2 days back. Girls get creative to be evasive, 
since if we turn them down upright we may never get their help. This is sad, good if we have a choice that we can not get help at all from them, 
but what if someone desperate needs to endure all the bullshit.

Confronting is the ultimate weapon but that could make things worse, I got creative. Creative how? Whatsapp stickers or just stickers and GIFs. 
We evade through the advances like this Tamil slang "Cycle gap ல லாரி ஓடிட்டா" (trying to get things done without noticing). My best friend is so so good at this! 
Shoutout to her crazy evasive skills, I called her every single time I faced such an issue. Virtual advances are taken care of, what about in-presence advances? Say no. 
Put them in a spot, it's fine. Just like reinforcement learning, if he's a good, and okay guy he'd through time know that you aren't interested in him and he'd back of without things getting awkward. 
But what if he's a psycho, confide in other people you trust, make sure to have screenshots, be brutally honest with the psycho and have a pepper spray just in case.

The whole point of me writing this is, that as much as our intentions are clear and genuine, it is not guaranteed that it would be the same from the other side. 
I've learnt to put myself away from these situations. People need to set things straight before even asking for help/favour. 
Not everybody is our friend, some are colleagues, acquaintances, bosses, project mates, classmates etc. If you have a choice just cut it then and there and move away. Period. 
If a friend behaves in such a manner, in Tamil slang again like a "boy/girl bestie", confront them and reason, else just move away from them. 
Ask yourself "laipe la erkanave romba oduthu, idhula indha thala-vali vera venuma?" and go on.

Huge shoutout to some men, who have genuine and clear intentions and who can establish the same with women they meet. (again applies irrespective of gender)

Innitha rant over, kadaiya sathalam.

Taata!
