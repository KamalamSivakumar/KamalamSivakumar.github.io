## math study plan

Plan for my upcoming math preparation, focusing on foundational graduate-level mathematics.  
Planned for the first two subjects, will upload the notes as progressed.  
The flow: **Calculus → Discrete Structures & Abstract Algebra → Graph Theory & Linear Algebra → Probability & Stochastic Models**

|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Limits and Continuity**  | Fundamental theorem of calculus, definitions, limits, continuity, piecewise continuity, and differentiability.                                                           |
| **Sequences and Series**   | Infinite sequences (convergence, divergence, Sandwich theorem, continuous function theorem). Infinite series (integral, comparison, ratio, and root tests).              |
|                            | Alternating series (absolute and conditional convergence). Power series, Taylor and Maclaurin series.                                                                    |
| **Functions of Two Variables** | Partial derivatives, geometrical interpretation, stationary points (maxima, minima, saddles), constrained optimization using Lagrange multipliers, and Taylor expansion. |
| **Multiple Integrals**     | Double integrals (Cartesian and polar), triple integrals (rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates). Applications: area, volume, moments, and masses.         |
| **Ordinary Differential Equations** | First-order linear equations, exact differential equations, Bernoulli equations, higher-order equations with constant coefficients, Euler’s equation, and modeling systems. |
