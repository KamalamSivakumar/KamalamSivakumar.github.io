## research, implement and publish (paagam 1)

Starting with this post, would be a series where I aim to fix a topic to write a research paper on, work on it up until publishing it. 
This would be my sole focus for the next coming days. Today's task would be to fix a topic. 
To begin with, I'm thinking of going with the ideas that involve game theory, like these:

1. Study bias in ML algorithms using Game Theory 

2. Algorithimic game theory for resource allocation

I'm also leaning towards time series analysis right now, because of it's vast applications.
After searching domains on google, these caught my attention. 

1. Supply chain Management with optimisation

2. Predictive maintenance and optimisation of servers

Now that I've thought about few ideas, I need to zero down on one. After thorough research on feasibility of completion, does the idea make sense?, the coolness factor and how hard would it be to execute, 
I've fixed on "Studying Bias in ML algorithms using Game Theory".

Now comes the research aspect. I'll be summarising checkpoints and the key concepts I'll need to work on for this to work.

1. Shapely values. 

2. Math behind shapely values.

3. Relate it with an ML Model.

4. Other techniques to study bias in an ML Model - Local Interoptibility methods.

5. Compare them?

After researching, I've gotten sucked onto a world of "Whattttttt! Interesting shittt!" and I'll stay here for a long while. All of it is so so cool!
I'll implement and work and learn on the same and get back with a post, until then please wait. 
In my journey of Data Science, Machine Learning and Statistics, a whole of 7 years, this is the first time I'm coming across Shapely values and how we can use them to model the contribution of variables in the Model for decision making.
Has anybody heard it or used it before? Please reach out to me and we'll connect. Maybe I'll know why I haven't heard of it while working on it, I don't know what obstacles I'm going to be facing, but one can hope right? This is a small win that I absolutely need right now.
I'm going to give it my all. And I'm pumped!

Also, song recommendation that is close to how I'm feeling right now would be [![Jorthale]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T61Sa9KD5jw)
