## presumptions, empathy and benefit of the doubt

My dad always mentions not to make any (ass)umptions, cause you would make an (ass) out of yourself.  
With assumptions you make a statement without any substantial proof, hence the ass.  
With presumption, you make an informed assumption, that is considered true until it can be proven otherwise.  
Having said that, presumptions should be made about other people, not assumptions. Presumptions can only be made by the inner circle, cause only they would know about their ebbs and flows.  
You cannot make a presumption about someone, before getting to know them, before giving them the benefit of the doubt. If you do you are an ass, cause it would be an assumption.  

Why would anyone not give the benefit of the doubt to another human being, at least once?  
Little to no empathy, egotistical and thinking that they are above the other.  
What does that make them feel? feel wanted? feel important? I don't know. It is not nice.   

It's absolutely the worst place to be where a person makes an assumption about you and you know they don't give you the benefit of the doubt, even to get to know you properly.  
Do you confront them? Do you subtly irk them? Do you patiently wait for them to give you the benefit of the doubt despite knowing it all, to make them understand you? What do you do?  
Ignore them. Don't give them the power to make you think their assumptions may be true.

Give people chances, talk to their face about the reservations you may have, and mitigate the assumption.  
Gossiping and making assumptions about someone behind their back isn't cool and reflects poorly on you. It's always better to address issues directly, you never know, what you'll find.  
Read pride and prejudice, or watch the movie. Two people absolutely clueless about how the other person actually is, a vortex of assumptions, ego and reservations. It was mitigated when they eventually spoke.  
It doesn't just apply to a romantic setting, it applies to every relationship. 

I constantly make the effort to communicate with my inner circle, to understand the presumptions I've made, or go to them with my assumptions about others and they hit me in the head, and advise me to give the benefit of the doubt. I'm not entirely perfect, but at least I try. 

Get to know someone before you make an ass out of yourself.
