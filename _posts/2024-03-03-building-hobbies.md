## hobbies, julie and julia, and me

Julie & Julia is one of my favourite movies. It is a breezy, hearty and realistic rom-com, that talks about how intertwined the lives of two women Julie & Julia are. 
I relate so much to that movie, it's like a warm hug for me. Like Julie, my life has its ups and downs, and I juggle my emotions in phases, proving my beloved paati's  words
"ரொம்ப சிரிச்சா, அப்பரம் அழுவ" (the vice-versa is possible too, and that's the way to look at it). The movie talks about finding solace in trying new things, 
like how Julie begins to take up the challenge to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook and blog about it. Also, how our obsession over someone or a celebrity would break if we interact with them in real life.
Like, when Julia comes to know about Julie's blog, she snarks at Julie, and Julie becomes dejected. Personally, to my observation, more than the connection between Julie and Julia, the similarities between their partners, was heart-warming for me. 
Such gentle men. If you have such men in your life, hold onto them.

Another lesson: The small wins matter the most, than the big ones. 

The small wins from trying new things are why my dopamine is kept in check, in this crazy world of Instagram and social media and its fast-getting dopamine loophole.
Me being me, can't keep up with a hobby for more than a month. So, to build long-term hobbies and restructure my routine and outlook, I've taken up this challenge: writing a blog post a day.
In the movie how Julie is fazed by everyday's mundane feelings and struggles, I'm to face them too, if and how I'm overcoming them is the climax.
Cooking and Baking make me happy. I tried making brown butter Turkish eggs, and I've fixated upon them as my go-to breakfast for the past week, earlier it was hummus. I love hummus.
Cooking probably is the only thing that I've been doing for years. Yes, it's a life skill maybe that's why, but that wouldn't explain why I cooked often back when I was living with my parents too. I've been cooking since my 10th grade.
Amma was out of town, so I cooked, grabbing the opportunity, Appa was my first lab rat. Appa still is my lab rat, in trying new recipes. It makes me happy, cooking and baking, especially for my loved ones, and like Julie gives me a sense of solace.

Other small wins I'm trying to conquer include, skating. It's really fun, I've just started though. One thing that tingged in my mind now was: that I needed to sway my weight from one side to the other to glide through with my skates, similarly swaying
through "அழுகை" and "சிரிப்பு" will let me glide through along with my small wins. One day at a time, I'm going to build hobbies that excite me and keep me looped just like how Instagram did. 
It would be tough, but I'm going to give my all.
